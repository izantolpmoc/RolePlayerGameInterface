*Language:* French

****************

This game takes place in a dystopian Paris during a strike. All reasonable people seem to have left the city.
You wake up in the middle of the street without a penny in your pocket and you will have to find your way back to safety.
Along the way, you might encounter some obstacles and ill intentioned people. Be ready to fight !

## Advice 
- You will earn XP by destructing obstacles and killing monsters (enemies). Of course, enemies will give you more XP.
- If you earned enough XP, you will level up and get some health back as well as some money.
- Be careful, if you are on the edge of the map, running away is not always an option.
- When you defeat an enemy or destroy an obstacle, you will receive some items. You can use them as weapons or sell them to the nearest seller.
- Keep in mind that you will need 50â‚¬ in your inventory when you reach the finish line to win the game.
- A rare item is "hidden" on the map...
- Any resemblance with the real Paris is only fortuite
